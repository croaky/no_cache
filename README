no_cache
========

This was extracted from a problem we had while building
a RESTful wizard without breaking the back button

http://giantrobots.thoughtbot.com/2008/4/25/pitfalls-in-restful-wizards

The no_cache plugin will force the browser to fetch a page
every time, including on clicks to the 'back' and 'forward'
buttons.

USAGE
=====

class PurchasesController < ApplicationController
  no_cache [:new, :edit]
end

class TeamsController < ApplicationController
  no_cache [:new]
end

# app/views/purchases/new, 
# app/views/purchases/edit, and 
# app/views/teams/new
